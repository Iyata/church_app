$query = "SELECT `date`, `message_content`, `department`.`dept_name`, `sender` 
		  FROM `message_history` INNER JOIN `department` ON `message_history.receiver`=`department.dept_name` 
		  ORDER BY `date` DESC"; #ADD WHERE CLAUSE LATER

HOW IT WORKS:
- The system sends messages via Multitexter BulkSMS API using
username=adikpeanthony@yahoo.com password=******* as login credentials


- A user can compose a message and send using one out of three mailing list options
a. stored contacts
b. pasted contacts
c. uploaded .csv file containing mailing phone numbers


- Uploaded csv file  must contain phone numbers in the form: 080########,090########


- A user can add new mailing lists to the data base using the "Add new category" link


- History of all previously sent messages can be seen via the "History" link



WHAT COULD BE ADDED
- Add only one contact to any category

- Retrieve the name of the department instead of the row id in the History section

- Allow only authorized users to gain access to the system

- Get detailed confirmation reports to the actual numbers that the message got delivered to
